This code allows you to perform a Structural, Acoustic and Vibroacoustic Modal Analysis using FEM and IGA in 3D (also in 1D and 2D).
The natural frequencies and modal shapes can be visualized. To optimize the mode visualization, Paraview will be used.

In the FEM folder, running the file FEM_VIBRO.m and it is possible to obtain the structural modes of a 3D hollow cylinder
and a 3D cylindrical acoustic cavity. In addition, 3D vibroacoustic frequencies obtained with a reduced model are also obtained.
In the IGA folder, running IGA_VIBRO.m it is possible to get the same as in the FEM analysis.

The folders 'C_files, meshing and nurbs-util' come from 'Vinh Phu Nguyen et al. “Isogeometric analysis: An overview and computer implementation aspects”. 
In: Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 117 (Nov. 1, 2015), pp. 89–116. issn: 0378-4754. doi: 10.1016/j.matcom.2015.05.008.'

The folder 'function_TL_CH' contains the all functions needed to reun the analysis and visualize the results.

To run the analysis, MATLAB and PARAVIEW (Open Source software) are necessary.

To optimize computation time, it is also necessary to install the “Parallel Computing Toolbox” package.
